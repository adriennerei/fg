            <h2>Importance of Nutrition and Meal Plans</h2>
            <p>
                Nutrition and meal plans are crucial for fitness as they support energy needs, muscle repair, and recovery. A balanced diet rich in unrefined carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats helps maintain optimal body weight and performance. Proper nutrition also ensures hydration and provides the necessary vitamins and minerals to boost long-term health. Without a well-planned diet, the body may struggle to meet the demands of training, leading to fatigue or poor recovery. Overall, good eating habits complement exercise for better results and overall well-being.
