                Fitness refers to a personâ€™s physical health and the ability to perform daily activities with ease. It includes five main components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. These factors work together to determine overall fitness and health. Regular exercise improves these components, promoting better physical performance and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
    Achieving fitness is a personal journey, shaped by individual goals and lifestyle. It requires a balance of aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility routines. Good nutrition and adequate recovery are also essential. Dedication to consistent exercise is key to improving and maintaining fitness.
